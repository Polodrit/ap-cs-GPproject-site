         <h2>Project 1 - Snap Predicates and drawing</h2>
         <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=gpdfyup&ProjectName=U2L3%20-%20Predicate">Snap Project</a></p>
          <p>The goal was to use predicates to make color changes while using the drawing code.
          I did it by using predicates to determine the location of the mouse, and created an area where the mouse location would affect the color output of the drawing tool.
          The challenge is that, it is very easy to get the greater than and less than signs mixed up.
         The lesson learned is that writing down what happens can make it easier to understand what is going on and why. This helps with fixing code or adding new code.

         <h2>Project 2 - Genius Hour Python CMU </h2>
         <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/collection/1747/3/exercise">Python CMU</a></p>
          <p>The goal was to use lines and ovals to create a complicated lantern design.I did it by overlaying the ovals first, then create the lines that go over the ovals.
The tricky part was Putting the right order of code since order matters in shapes for python.
I learned that Line width can be long enough to essentially become a replacement for rectangles.

         <h2>Project 3 -Christmas house and block coding
</h2>
         <p><a href="https://www.blockscad3d.com/community/projects/1078334">Christmas Project</a></p>
          <p>The goal was to make something Christmas-related using block coding. I started by making a brick, then a house, then trees, then one tree into a Christmas tree, and finally randomized presents.
The main obstacle was getting used to the many controls to view the creation was an obstacle, but as I took my time with the process, the mastery of the controls got significantly better.
I learned that starting easy can lead to more complicated designs, but patience is a must.

          <p>The goal was to use make a drawing app to win the congressional app challenge.
          Michael and I did it by creating a decent user interface that anyone can use while easily learning the content.
         The lesson I learned is that colors factors are different when using the pen tool and changing the color of a sprite.
