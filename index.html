         <h2>Project 1 - Snap Predicates and drawing</h2>
         <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=gpdfyup&ProjectName=U2L3%20-%20Predicate">SnapProject</a></p>
          <p>Goal: Use predicates to make color changes while using the drawing code.
          How: I used predicates to determine the location of the mouse, and created an area where the mouse location would affect the color output of the drawing tool.
          Challenges: It is very easy to get the greater than and less than signs mixed up.
         Lessons learned: Writing down what happens can make it easier to understand what is going on and why. This helps with fixing code or adding new code.

         <h2>Project 2 - Genius Hour Python CMU </h2>
         <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/collection/1747/3/exercise">Python CMU</a></p>
          <p>Goal: Use lines and ovals to create a complicated lantern design.
How: Overlay the ovals first, then create the lines that go over the ovals.
Challenges: Putting the right order of code was a challenge since order matters in shapes for python.
Lessons learned: Line width can be long enough to essentially become a replacement for rectangles.

         <h2>Project 3 -Christmas house and block coding
</h2>
         <p><a href="https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=gpdfyup&ProjectName=U2L3%20-%20Predicate">SnapProject</a></p>
          <p>Goal: Make something Christmas-related using block coding.
How: I started making a brick, then a house, then trees, then one tree into a Christmas tree, and finally randomized presents.
Challenges: Getting used to the many controls to view the creation was an obstacle, but as the process lingered, the mastery of the controls got significantly better.
Lessons learned: Starting easy can lead to more complicated designs, but patience is a must.
